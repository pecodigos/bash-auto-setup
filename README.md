## BASH AUTO COMMAND LINE EXECUTE

I made this simple program so it can help me whenever I need to make a fresh linux install. I have a folder with a lot of bash commands I do in a fresh install.

For example: 
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
`sudo apt install picom`
`sudo apt install maim`

...and so on.

## How to use it

After executing the program, it will prompt you for the path from where the file in located.
For Linux users, usually the path will start with `/home/{YOUR_USERNAME_HERE}/` since `~` won't make a good substitute in this case.

Feel free to use this program as you want, as long as it's not for commercial purposes.
